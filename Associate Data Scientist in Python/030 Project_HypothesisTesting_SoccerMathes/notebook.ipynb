This would make an interesting investigative article that your subscribers are bound to love, but you'll need to perform a valid statistical hypothesis test to be sure!\n","\n","While scoping this project, you acknowledge that the sport has changed a lot over the years, and performances likely vary a lot depending on the tournament, so you decide to limit the data used in the analysis to only official `FIFA World Cup` matches (not including qualifiers) since `2002-01-01`.\n","\n","You create two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century, which you scraped from a reliable online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: `women_results.csv` and `men_results.csv`.\n","\n","The question you are trying to determine the answer to is:\n","\n","> Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?\n","\n","You assume a **10% significance level**, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n","\n","$H_0$ : The mean number of goals scored in
