Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.\n","\n","You've been hired by a major online data science training provider called *Training Data Ltd.* to clean up one of their largest customer datasets. This dataset will eventually be used to predict whether their students are looking for a new job or not, information that they will then use to direct them to prospective recruiters.\n","\n","You've been given access to `customer_train.csv`, which is a subset of their entire customer dataset, so you can create a proof-of-concept of a much more efficient storage solution.
